#RQ that are gobal to each event, as opposed to on a channel-to-channel basis
global:
  hpos: float #horiz position of the event[mm]
  vpos: float #vertical position of the event[mm]
  n_clusters: float #number of clusters (particles) in the event
  sys_time: int #320 MHz counter synchronous with 40 MHz sampling clock
  wr_time: int #250 MHz counter PLLd from 100 MHz output of WR ZEN
  filename: string #name of the file the event came from
  file_time: float #timestamp unix epoch from filename 
  evt_count: int #event index in the file it came from
  pps: float #1 Hz counter pulse-per-second from WR ZEN
  first_peak: float #times in ns of first pulse hitting readout
  wr_phi: float #phase from fitting sin(omega*t - phi)
  wr_freq: float #the WR 250 MHz frequency, in case it is not fixed
  peak_ch: int #channel with the maximum amplitude for each event.
  start_cap: int #left bound of the trigger octant, from 0 to 255
  error_codes: array_int #a list of error codes for the event that indicate why it failed to reconstruct
  total_charge: float #add unit later, total charge in the event from reconstructable waveforms
  time_measured_ch: int #channel that is used for the time of arrival reconstruction. Currently only one channel is used per event. If peak_ch is populated, this is usually the same channel.

#channel specific reduced quantities, which will have a key
#like "ch3_"+reduced_quantity_name. References the strip-number
#corrected channel number, not the original raw data chip channel
channel:
  baseline: float #mV, baseline of the waveform
  baseline_std: float #mV, standard deviation of the baseline on the waveform
  full_std: float #mV, standard deviation of the full waveform
  max: float #mV, maximum sample of the waveform
  min: float #mV, minimum sample of the waveform
  is_hit: int #0 or 1, whether the channel has enough amplitude to consider for reconstruction
  peak_times: array_float #only if is_hit, times in ns of the peaks in the waveform
  amplitude: float #only if is_hit, amplitudes in mV of the primary peak in the waveform. This can be different from max/min after spline fit.
